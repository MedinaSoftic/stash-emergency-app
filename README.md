# stash-emergency-app
Unit 1 end of unit project 

This project is currently live here: https://stash-emergency.netlify.app/ 
During my time at LaunchCode, I was tasked with developing a single-page application (SPA) using only front-end technologies and JavaScript. I created a user-friendly platform designed to centralize critical resources and information from government and nonprofit organizations, aimed at supporting individuals in the U.S. before and after natural disasters. (This project is still being updated to allow for better features and information).
